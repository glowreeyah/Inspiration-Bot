# Inspiration-Bot 

This is a Ruby based Telegram bot that gives inspiring messages on request from the user with notifications and reminders to document their thoughts. It is a church bot that was built to aid church members to remember the word of God. This will remind them daily of their faith and testimonies to keep them going. I hope to make it permanently running for use.

## Features
